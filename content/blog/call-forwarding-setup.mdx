Setting up call forwarding to an AI receptionist takes less than 10 minutes. You keep your existing business number — customers dial the same number they always have. The calls simply route to your AI receptionist instead of (or in addition to) ringing at your office. No number changes, no carrier switching, no technical expertise required.

Here's exactly how to set it up on any phone system, with step-by-step instructions for landlines, cell phones, and VoIP systems.

## The 4 Types of Call Forwarding

Before diving into setup instructions, understand the four main types of call forwarding. Each serves different use cases.

**1. Unconditional Forwarding (All Calls)**

Every call goes straight to your AI receptionist. Your office phone doesn't ring at all. Calls route directly to the AI.

**Best for:** Businesses that want 24/7 AI coverage, trial periods where you're testing the AI before committing, solo operators who are always in the field and never at a desk.

**Setup:** Dial `*72` followed by the AI receptionist's number on most traditional phone carriers. On cell phones and VoIP systems, configure in settings (instructions below).

**To cancel:** Dial `*73` to turn off forwarding and return calls to your normal phone.

**2. No-Answer Forwarding (Ring Then Forward)**

Your office phone rings for 3-4 rings. If nobody picks up, the call forwards to your AI receptionist. This is the most common setup for businesses with office staff.

**Best for:** Most businesses. You answer when you're available and at your desk. The AI catches everything you miss — when you're with a customer, in the bathroom, at lunch, out in the field, or after hours.

**Setup:** Dial `*71` followed by the AI receptionist's number on most carriers. On VoIP systems, configure "call forwarding if no answer" in your admin portal.

**Why it's recommended:** Zero downside. You maintain control of calls during business hours, but nothing goes to voicemail ever again. It's the lowest-risk way to implement AI coverage.

**3. Busy Forwarding**

Forwards calls to your AI receptionist only when all your phone lines are busy. If someone's on your main line, overflow calls go to the AI instead of getting a busy signal.

**Best for:** Businesses with multiple lines that occasionally get overwhelmed during peak hours. HVAC companies during summer heat waves, plumbers during freeze emergencies, dental offices during morning rush.

**Setup:** Dial `*67` followed by the AI number on some carriers (not all carriers support this). On VoIP systems, configure in call handling rules.

**4. Schedule-Based Forwarding**

Forward calls to your AI receptionist only outside business hours. During your 8am-5pm workday, calls ring normally. After 5pm, weekends, and holidays, calls route to the AI.

**Best for:** Businesses that want to answer themselves during business hours but need after-hours coverage. Also good for testing — start with after-hours only, then expand to full coverage after confirming it works well.

**Setup:** Must be configured in a VoIP system (RingCentral, Vonage, 8x8, etc.) or manually toggled using `*72` and `*73` at the start and end of each day.

**Recommendation:** For most businesses, we recommend **no-answer forwarding (option 2)**. You still answer calls when you're available, but the AI catches everything you miss. It's the best of both worlds.

## Setup by Phone System

The exact setup process depends on what type of phone system you use. Here are step-by-step instructions for each common system.

### Landline (Traditional Carrier)

If you have a traditional landline from AT&T, Verizon, Spectrum, or similar carriers:

**For all calls (unconditional forwarding):**
1. Pick up your office phone
2. Dial `*72`
3. Wait for the dial tone
4. Dial the AI receptionist's phone number (provided in your RingCrew welcome email)
5. Wait for the confirmation tone or message
6. Hang up

Your landline is now forwarding all calls to the AI.

**To cancel:** Pick up the phone and dial `*73`. You'll hear a confirmation tone. Forwarding is now off.

**For no-answer forwarding:**
1. Pick up your office phone
2. Dial `*71`
3. Wait for the dial tone
4. Dial the AI receptionist's number
5. Wait for confirmation
6. Hang up

Now your phone will ring 3-4 times. If you don't answer, it forwards to the AI.

**Note:** Some carriers charge per-forwarded-minute for landline forwarding (typically $0.05-$0.15 per minute). Check with your carrier. VoIP systems usually don't charge forwarding fees.

### iPhone (Cellular)

If you're using your personal cell phone as your business line or want to forward your mobile number:

1. Open **Settings** app
2. Scroll down and tap **Phone**
3. Tap **Call Forwarding**
4. Toggle **Call Forwarding** to ON (green)
5. Tap **Forward To**
6. Enter the AI receptionist's phone number
7. Tap back — you should see the number saved

Now all calls to your iPhone will forward to the AI receptionist.

**Note:** This forwards ALL calls, including personal calls. For selective forwarding, use your carrier's codes:
- Verizon: Dial `*71` + AI number for no-answer forwarding
- AT&T: Dial `*61*` + AI number + `*11#` for no-answer
- T-Mobile: Dial `**61*` + AI number + `**20#` for no-answer

### Android (Cellular)

On most Android phones:

1. Open the **Phone** app
2. Tap the three dots menu (usually top right)
3. Tap **Settings**
4. Tap **Calls** or **Call Settings**
5. Tap **Call forwarding**
6. Tap **Forward when unanswered**
7. Enter the AI receptionist's number
8. Tap **Enable** or **Turn on**

The exact menu names vary by Android manufacturer (Samsung, Google Pixel, etc.) but the general path is similar.

### RingCentral / VoIP Systems

If you use RingCentral, Vonage, 8x8, Ooma, Nextiva, or another business VoIP system:

1. Log into your admin portal (usually a web interface)
2. Navigate to **Phone System** or **Extensions**
3. Find **Call Handling** or **Call Forwarding** settings
4. Add a new forwarding rule
5. Select the condition:
   - "Always forward" for unconditional
   - "Forward if no answer after X rings" for no-answer (set to 3-4 rings)
   - "Forward outside business hours" for schedule-based
6. Enter the AI receptionist's number as the forwarding destination
7. Save the rule

Most VoIP systems let you set up multiple rules. You can create one rule for "forward after 4 rings during business hours" and another for "forward immediately after hours." This gives you maximum flexibility.

### Google Voice

If you use Google Voice for your business number:

1. Open **Google Voice** (voice.google.com)
2. Click the **gear icon** (Settings)
3. Click **Calls** in the left menu
4. Scroll to **Call forwarding**
5. Click **Add another phone**
6. Enter the AI receptionist's number
7. Click **Send code** (Google will call the number to verify)
8. Enter the verification code from the call
9. Save

Now you can toggle which phones ring when someone calls your Google Voice number. Check only the AI receptionist's number to forward all calls, or check both your regular phone and the AI number to ring both simultaneously (first to answer gets the call).

## Important Things to Know

Before you set up call forwarding, here are a few critical details:

**Your existing number doesn't change.** Customers still call the same number they always have. They dial your regular business number, and behind the scenes it forwards to the AI. From the customer's perspective, nothing is different — they call you, someone answers immediately.

**Check for carrier forwarding fees.** Traditional landline carriers sometimes charge per-forwarded-minute (typically $0.05-$0.15 per minute). VoIP systems usually don't charge forwarding fees. Cell phones vary by carrier and plan. Check your phone bill or call your carrier to confirm. If there are fees, factor them into your cost calculations.

**Test after setup.** Once you've configured forwarding, call your business number from a different phone to verify the AI answers. Make sure the greeting sounds right, test booking an appointment, ask a question to confirm the knowledge base is working. It's better to catch configuration issues during testing than on your first real customer call.

**You can turn forwarding on/off anytime.** Call forwarding isn't permanent. For landlines, dial `*73` to turn it off instantly. For cell phones and VoIP systems, toggle it in settings. Some businesses manually control forwarding — `*72` at the end of the workday to forward after-hours calls, `*73` in the morning to return to normal. This gives you complete control.

**Multiple forwarding numbers create confusion.** If you have multiple phone numbers for your business, you'll need to set up forwarding for each one. Make sure you forward the number customers actually call (usually your Google Business Profile number, website number, and any numbers in local directories).

## The Alternative: Get a New Local Number

If you don't want to touch your existing phone number setup — maybe you have complex routing, multiple departments, or you're just not comfortable changing anything — there's a simpler option: get a new local number specifically for your AI receptionist.

RingCrew can provide a new phone number in your local area code. Use this number on:
- Your Google Business Profile (your primary number in local search)
- Your website
- Google Ads, Facebook ads, and other marketing campaigns
- Yard signs, vehicle wraps, and print materials

Your original number stays exactly as it is. The new number routes to the AI from day one. You can even keep both numbers long-term — AI handles the new number, you handle the old number however you currently do.

Many businesses actually prefer this approach because it lets them track which calls come from different marketing sources. Google Ads calls come to the AI number. Existing customers who have your old number call the original line. You can measure exactly how many leads the AI captures from marketing vs. existing customer base.

The downside is you have two numbers to manage. The upside is zero risk to your current setup.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will my customers know calls are being forwarded?**

No. Call forwarding is completely invisible to the caller. They dial your regular business number. The call rings and someone answers. From their perspective, nothing is different than if you answered directly. There's no "this call is being forwarded" message or delay.

**Can I forward only after-hours calls?**

Yes. Use schedule-based forwarding in your VoIP system to forward outside business hours only. Or manually toggle forwarding on/off using `*72` and `*73` codes at the start and end of each day. Some businesses use no-answer forwarding during the day (ring 4 times then forward if nobody answers) and unconditional forwarding after hours (immediately forward all calls). You have complete flexibility. Learn more about maximizing [after-hours call coverage](/blog/after-hours-calls).

**What if I change my mind?**

Dial `*73` on a landline or toggle call forwarding OFF in your phone settings. It takes 10 seconds to disable. Your phone returns to normal operation immediately. Call forwarding is not permanent or irreversible. You can turn it on and off as many times as you want.
